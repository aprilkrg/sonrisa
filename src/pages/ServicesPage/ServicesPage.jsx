                <p>My background includes meeting people where they are at. In pre-pandemic times, I worked for an agency that allowed me to meet clients in parks, coffee shops, schools, libraries and other public spaces.</p> <br/>
                <p>Now in the pandemic, I offer meeting in parks so we can walk and talk at your pace. This can reduce awkwardness and provide gentle exercise that can reduce symptoms of many mental disorders.</p>
